## Opening Comments

Jeney opened by reminding people that she previously worked at SSRL in the SMB group, across MFX at LCLS and SSRL MX beamlines: this highlighted the value in having synchrotron beamlines which mirror the XFEL beamlines directly (e.g. similar sample handling) - access to synchrotron time is a lot easier than XFEL though so you should think about doing your experiments there unless you really can't - talk to beamline scientists to help motivate why you need an XFEL when you come to apply for time. The synchrotron and XFEL experiments are conceptually similar but in both cases a barrier is processing stills, with the additional complexities for XFEL.

Kunio opened with his background as a beamline scientists at a microfocus beamline at SPring8, and his interest in automating data collection.
