## Opening Comments

Jeney opened by reminding people that she previously worked at SSRL in the SMB group, across MFX at LCLS and SSRL MX beamlines: this highlighted the value in having synchrotron beamlines which mirror the XFEL beamlines directly (e.g. similar sample handling) - access to synchrotron time is a lot easier than XFEL though so you should think about doing your experiments there unless you really can't - talk to beamline scientists to help motivate why you need an XFEL when you come to apply for time. The synchrotron and XFEL experiments are conceptually similar but in both cases a barrier is processing stills, with the additional complexities for XFEL.

Kunio opened with his background as a beamline scientists at a microfocus beamline at SPring8, and his interest in automating data collection. He took part in XFEL experiments at SACLA back in 2013-4 performing radiation damage-free studies metalloproteins, where huge (500µm) crystals of PSII were used and around 1,000 still shots per data set were processed individually with MOSFLM. They then moved on to a different time resolved analysis, SFROX, at room temperature with (again) large crystals, laser excitation and rotation between images (a combination which is unique to SACLA.) This allows time periods of ns to µs between laser and X-ray pulses, at 30Hz, with a very high brightness and short (<10fs) pulse length. This needs an automated pipeline to keep up with data collection, to give live feedback which is as complete and informative as possible. XFEL experiments need a _lot_ of people (this is a well understood problem) who need to work hard and around the clock in a coordinated manner. Standardising on some areas would simplify, as would routinely testing at synchrotron before using very scarse XFEL time.
