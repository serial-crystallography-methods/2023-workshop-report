# What is stopping us from publishing?

**Moderator:** Jeney Wierman

**Panelists:** Graeme Winter, Aaron Brewster, Iris Young, Derek Mendez

The 2023 workshop session titled "What is stopping us from publishing?” Crystallography," moderated by Jeney Wierman, brought together experts to discuss why publishing results from serial macromolecular crystallography (SMX) remains slow and sporadic, despite the technique's promise and increasing sophistication. The panel—Graeme Winter, Aaron Brewster, Iris Young, and Derek Mendez—reflected on several key issues holding the field back from more rapid and widespread dissemination of results.

A major theme of the discussion was the complexity of SMX data analysis and validation. Large volumes of data, combined with subtle signals and experimental noise, make interpretation difficult and time-consuming. Tools and pipelines are still maturing, and without universally accepted validation metrics, researchers often struggle with when and how to finalize results. This can lead to a state of "analysis paralysis," where data is collected but never published.

The inherently collaborative nature of many SMX experiments further slows the process. Aligning goals, sharing data, and navigating authorship across institutions creates logistical and interpersonal challenges. Many end-users still depend heavily on method developers for both experimental setup and analysis, which limits the scalability and speed of SMX research.

Beamtime scarcity and proposal culture also contribute to the problem. Access to XFELs is highly competitive, and researchers often feel pressured to over-promise in their proposals. The result is ambitious experiments that may yield partial or inconclusive results. Combined with the complexity of the setups and the unpredictability of custom instrumentation, this environment can make both execution and publication daunting.

Technical hurdles persist as well. Sample preparation and delivery remain inconsistent, and real-time feedback—critical for knowing when to stop or adapt an experiment—is not always available. Without this, researchers can end up with large but unusable datasets. Furthermore, challenges like detector performance, instrument instability, and limited control data make robust analysis more difficult.

Cultural factors also play a significant role. The peer review process is often slow and sometimes skeptical of SMX methods, particularly when results are unintuitive or lack traditional validation. The field still lacks standardized reporting norms, and there is a perception that only "big" findings are worth publishing. Comparisons to techniques like cryo-EM, which currently enjoy more popularity and funding, can further erode confidence and enthusiasm.

Despite these challenges, the panel offered several solutions. These included creating shared validation metrics and best practices, fostering better support for end-users through outreach and collaboration, and adopting science campaign models to ease proposal pressure. The panel also advocated for more honest and transparent publishing—including negative results—and greater integration with synchrotron facilities for preliminary screening.
Perhaps most importantly, the panel emphasized the need to change how the field communicates its value. The perception that crystallography is a "mature" technique has led to decreased funding and visibility, even as new applications and technical advances continue to emerge. Highlighting these developments and showcasing successful biological insights from SMX will be essential to sustaining momentum.

The conversation concluded on a cautiously optimistic note. While the barriers to publishing in SMX are real and multifaceted, the panelists agreed that with better planning, community standards, and a cultural shift toward collaboration and transparency, the field can overcome these challenges. There is a need to invest not only in instruments and beamlines but also in people—especially those who can bridge the gap between methods and meaningful biological outcomes.
