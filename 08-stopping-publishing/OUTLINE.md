# OUTLINE
## Introduction

The session began by acknowledging a striking trend in the field: despite rapid advances in serial macromolecular crystallography (SMX) and a growing body of technique-focused literature, relatively few structures are published from end-user driven experiments. Most published SMX datasets revolve around a small set of well-characterized model proteins. A significant portion of collected data remains unpublished or unprocessed, raising questions about barriers to publication and validation.

Jeney Wierman prompted the audience and panel with questions like:
- What’s stopping us from publishing?
- Are we only publishing data from developers, or is the technique being used more broadly?
- Are end-users reaching meaningful biological insights?
- Are we focusing too much on low-hanging fruit, leaving difficult but valuable targets unexplored?

## Core Themes and Barriers to Publishing

### 1. Complexity of Data Analysis & Validation
- Large data volumes and the complexity of SMX experiments often result in long delays between data collection and analysis.
- Small signals, stochastic beam conditions, and experimental noise complicate interpretation.
- Tools are still maturing, and validation remains difficult due to the lack of universally accepted metrics.
- There's often no clear end-point; analysis can become "analysis paralysis" without strong validation protocols.

"Getting the structure isn't the end—it's the beginning of the science. But validation is hard and slows us down." – Aaron Brewster

### 2. Collaboration & Workflow Bottlenecks
- Many experiments are large collaborative efforts, which inherently move slowly.
- Aligning expectations, data management, and authorship across institutions is a hurdle.
- The support model at beamlines varies: some users are highly independent; others require expert involvement throughout.

"Serial crystallography experiments often depend on developers—not many users can go it alone. We need more trained collaborators." – Jeney Wierman

### 3. Beamtime & Facility Pressure
- Beamtime is precious and competitive. This drives over-promising in proposals and creates pressure to deliver high-impact results.
- Complex experimental setups and ambitious goals often result in incomplete or ambiguous datasets.
- Proposal culture at XFELs may favor high-risk, high-impact ideas, but data doesn’t always live up to the pitch.

"Sometimes we’re swinging for the fences. It sets us up for disappointment and delays." – Ray Sierra

### 4. Technological and Logistical Hurdles
- Sample prep, delivery methods, and instrumentation (e.g., goniometers, detectors) remain imperfect.
- Real-time feedback is critical but not always available. Without live processing, it’s hard to know when to stop collecting or change strategies.
- Custom setups are hard to reproduce, and system instability often requires troubleshooting mid-experiment.

"At 20 kHz you just collect and sort later. But for many users, that's not yet feasible." – Derek Mendez

### 5. Cultural & Structural Issues in Science
- The peer review process can be slow and unreceptive to SMX due to unfamiliarity.
- Lack of standardization and agreed-upon metrics hinders confidence in results.
- Many feel the pressure to report "big" findings, which discourages incremental or negative results.
- Comparisons to cryo-EM and other "hot" techniques contribute to funding and perception challenges.

"We need to be ready to explain why this technique matters—without sounding defensive." – Art Lyubimov

## Ideas and Solutions from the Panel

- Standardization: Develop clearer, community-wide validation tools and benchmarks (e.g., for SNR, difference maps, resolution).
- Lower Barriers to Entry: Increase support for end-users through better outreach, collaboration models, and onboarding practices.
- Campaign Models: Adopt science campaign models to reduce proposal pressure and foster continuity (as at LCLS).
- Training & Staffing: Advocate for increased staffing and training of beamline scientists to support more users more effectively.
- Honest Publishing: Encourage preprints, negative results, and transparent reporting of failure.
- Integration with Synchrotron Work: Use synchrotron access for pre-screening and intermediate stages to reduce XFEL dependency.
- Targeted Advocacy: Push back on funding perceptions that crystallography is “mature”; highlight niches and ongoing innovations.

"We might be too hard on ourselves. There are a lot of good papers coming out. The field is moving forward." – Aaron Brewster

## Closing Thoughts

The conversation emphasized that the slow pace of publication in SMX is a multifaceted problem involving technical, cultural, and systemic challenges. While the technique offers extraordinary opportunities, the community must continue to evolve its infrastructure, expectations, and outreach. Participants agreed that more realism in planning, transparency in outcomes, and investment in training and validation will be key to moving forward.
